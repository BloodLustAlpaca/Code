Problem 12.4 When you arrive at the pub, your five friends already have their drinks on
the table. Jim has a job and buys the round half of the time. Jane buys the round a
quarter of the time, and Sarah and Simon buy a round one eighth of the time. John
hasn’t got his wallet out since you met him three years ago.
Compute the entropy of each of them buying the round and work out how many
questions you need to ask (on average) to find out who bought the round.
Two more friends now arrive and everybody spontaneously decides that it is your turn
to buy a round (for all eight of you). Your friends set you the challenge of deciding
who is drinking beer and who is drinking vodka according to their gender, whether or
not they are students, and whether they went to the pub last night. Use ID3 to work
it out, and then see if you can prune the tree.

Drink Gender Student Pub last night
Beer 	T 	T 	T
Beer 	T	F	T
Vodka 	T 	F 	F
Vodka 	T 	F 	F
Vodka 	F 	T 	T
Vodka 	F 	F 	F
Vodka 	F 	T 	T
Vodka 	F 	T 	T


P1: Calculate entropy
E=-p*log2(p)

Jim:-(1/2)*log2(1/2)=.5
Jane:-(1/4)*log2(1/4)=.5
Sarah:-(1/8)*log2*(1/8) =.375
Simon:-(1/8)*log2(1/8)=.375
Jon:0*log2(0)=0

3 or less questions, usually asking if Jim bought is enough. If not him Jane probably bought

We Can trim Student, We can find out if they drank vodka by asking if they went to the publast night and gender. If Gender:T and pub:T then they got beer else vodka
